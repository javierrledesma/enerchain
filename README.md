This is the resulting code of the final degree project of Jesús García Ovejero: Design and development of a payment system without intermediaries for energy based on the Ethereum blockchain.

The objective of this work is to make a payment system without intermediaries and to be carried out automatically for any type of service provided.
Because of the demand for self-consumption in renewable energy is standing out in Spain, it has been decided to use this case as an example, to carry out a decentralized system to be able to commercialize the surplus of energy generated locally without the need for a centralized intermediary.
Among the most innovative technologies that are having high demand today, blockchain stands out, which is known worldwide thanks to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency platform, but it has many more possibilities. For example, it allows the creation of decentralized applications that are also safe and reliable.
Thanks to the use of this technology, a cheap and easy-to-follow solution is proposed through which the payments made from one entity to another will be automated to buy their surplus energy. In short, it is a primary facilitator that allows the parties to interact without knowing or trusting each other.
Additionally, a web platform has been designed that allows to keep track of the different transactions that are carried out, accessible only by the entities that use this system
